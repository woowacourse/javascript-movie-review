To carry out the investigation, Jodie must rely on her father Mark and an unlikely ally: Matt, a hacker with a criminal past.

But is he really responsible, or is someone trying to frame him?\r The film explores, through interviews with experts and fictional scenarios, how technology is transforming cities, mobility, healthcare, sustainability and even space exploration.",
